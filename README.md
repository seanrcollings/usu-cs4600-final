# Gift Giver

Gift Giver is a  "wedding registry" like app where people can add gifts to list and then invite people to their list. Then people who are invited to the list can use the list to coordinate purchasing the gifts for the list's owner, but the owner themselves cannot see anything that they are doing, keeping it as a surprise.
